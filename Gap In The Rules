## Gap In The Rules

I think there exists a gap in the description of the rules and here it is. It is not defined what to do with the application of the customers whose credit scores 
are between 500 and 1000 and whose salaries are over 5000. As an assumption, I did not insert these applications to the database and I did not not call send SMS method
as they are not approved nor disapproved. But still, I updated or created customer information for those applicants.
